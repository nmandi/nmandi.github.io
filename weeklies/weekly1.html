  <h3>I think that diagrams can be used to create new meaning. As the work of Arakawa and Gins has demonstrated, diagrams are an art form that straddles the fields of science, philosophy, and the arts. They provoke thought in a viewer/reader in a new way, described by the philosopher Lyotard as <q>[thinking] through the eyes.</q> The very nature of diagrammatic art relies on creating connections between objects, concepts, and themes that the viewer would likely not have realized themselves. However, it is up to the viewer to understand how these newly revealed connections apply to other aspects of their lives to see what the greater picture is. I think that diagrams for art and diagrams for non-art are actually quite similar. The subject of a diagram does affect the way it communicates with a viewer. For example, scientific diagrams aim to be as self-explanatory and clear as possible, usually serving to explain a concept that is difficult to explain in words. Diagrams for art, however, are not always so self-explanatory, and require some contemplation by the viewer in order for the intended connections to be drawn.</h3>
