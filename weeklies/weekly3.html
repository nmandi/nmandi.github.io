  <h3>Society&#39s treatment and understanding of poor images demonstrates our materiality. This can be seen through the example mentioned in the reading, of a speaker who refused to show images because they weren&#39t of a high enough quality. We would rather not see and image at all than see one poorly. I think it relates to society&#39s <q>all or nothing</q> attitude about representing thoughts and communicating ideas. We would like to have our thoughts and ideas either fully understood, or not at all known, but definitely not misunderstood. Materiality is shown in our rejection of poor images in cinema as <q>experimental and essayistic cinema became almost invisible,</q> making us miss out on a lot of content purely based on its visual quality, not its actual quality. The poor image represents the ways in which socieoeconomic status became tied to visual culture and cinema. Producing images at their highest quality requires expensive technologies and time, which renders those who cannot afford these things silenced, or to have their work written off as poor quality. The environment of poor images contains <q>experimental and artistic material, but also incredible amounts of porn and paranoia</q> and by grouping these things together, the association of bad image quality with bad content is created in the minds of consumers. This means that only high quality images will ever be given <q>mainstream</q> recognition. In addition, poor images are the ones that can be shared and viewed by many because of their small file size. The high velocity of digital images is what allows them to have power and influence increasingly larger audiences on the internet, and the poorer an image, the faster it can be spread, but the harder it is to understand.
